Here it is! A nice, neat little package with all of the information that you would care to know about me. 

I spent some time thinking about how I wanted to set this site up, so I thought I would use my first blog post to summarize for the curious.
This is a static site, powered by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) . I can use Markdown to easily author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Depending on what URL you used to get here, you might be experiencing a domain redirect. I had originally planned to stand up my own site entirely, but opted to use an option that had less overhead maintence. The more time available to spend on content, the better.
